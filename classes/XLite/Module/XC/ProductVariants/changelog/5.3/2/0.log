Fixes
2016-11-22 - [Bug] For products with variants and a relative discount, a wrong old price was displayed; instead of the variant price, the product price was shown. #BUG-4156 (Sergey Elmanov) #Sale #ProductVariants
2016-08-31 - [Bug] In a product listing, a product was showing as Out of stock if its default variant was Out of stock, and the other variants were In stock. Now the product is showing as Out of stock only if all its variants are Out of stock. #BUG-3788 (Maxim Kuznetsov) #ProductVariants
2016-08-26 - [Bug] The maximum quantity available for purchase for variants was taken from the qty field of the default variant, not the variant chosen by customer. Fixed. #BUG-3777 (Michael Lipinski) #ProductVariants
