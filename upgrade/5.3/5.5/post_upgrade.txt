To reduce server load which may be caused by requests for images and files that are missing from the server, edit the file .htaccess in the root of your X-Cart directory to insert the following configuration directives:
1. In the .htaccess file, find the below code block:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ cart.php?url=$1 [NC,L,QSA]

2. Replace it with the following code block:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^((?!images/|files/|var/theme/images/).*)$ cart.php?url=$0 [NC,L,QSA]
